## Welcome

I’m **0xh4ty**, a Linux enthusiast, Emacs user, hacker, and programmer. I created this blog to document my learning, share insights, and connect with others interested in Web3 security.

## My Background

I started my journey in security with Web2, spending two years learning penetration testing and bug bounty hunting. I worked through ***Linux Basics for Hackers***, the **Junior Penetration Tester** path on TryHackMe, and earned the **HTB CBBH** (Certified Bug Bounty Hunter) certification on Hack The Box. Now, I’m transitioning into Web3 security and smart contract auditing.

## Interests

I enjoy working in a keyboard-driven workflow and use Emacs for everything from coding to writing. Outside of security, I’m also learning Rust for recreational programming.

## Education

I hold a **Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA)** and focus on continuous learning in security and programming.

## Beyond Tech

I have a deep love for pigeons and find them just as fascinating as hacking.
