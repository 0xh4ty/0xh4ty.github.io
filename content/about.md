## Welcome

I’m **0xh4ty**, a Linux enthusiast, Emacs user, hacker, and programmer. I created this blog to document my learning, share insights, and connect with others interested in Web3 security.

## My Background

I started my journey in security with Web2, spending two years learning penetration testing and specializing in web application hacking. I worked through ***Linux Basics for Hackers***, the **Junior Penetration Tester** path on TryHackMe, and earned the **HTB CWES** (Certified Web Exploitation Specialist) certification on Hack The Box. Now, I’m transitioning into Web3 security and smart contract auditing.

## Interests

I enjoy working in a keyboard-driven workflow and use Emacs for everything from coding to writing. Rust began as a hobby, and I even built the static site generator powering this blog, along with many other projects. Today, I’m learning it in depth with Solana security as my focus.

## Education

With a **Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA)** as my foundation, I focus on continuous development in security and programming.

## Beyond Tech

I have a deep love for pigeons and find them just as fascinating as hacking.
